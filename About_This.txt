This Is Python Packages in which we insert Modules of different types
that are used later in our python files where we need for importing modules

1.Dir or Folder Name
This dir have a name of CalculatingModules => Basicly it is name of package we can
create a package with specific name that clear the purpose of package

2.File name in this dir
In this dir there is a file of name "__init.py__" => it is name of modules location
basicly it give the information to python intrepreter that this is a location of
packages which contain different modules.

3.Use of packages
The Use of these packges in our python files are same as we import modules in files

for eg:-
import CalculatingModules

modules_use.function_use
